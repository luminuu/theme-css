# theme-css
This is a sample repository to show the idea of a possible setup for the new default WordPress theme. It is based on the ITCSS methodology ([this article explains it pretty good](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/)) and adapted to fit the needs of a WordPress theme. Please see the style.scss file for more comments. Some individual files have comments as well.
